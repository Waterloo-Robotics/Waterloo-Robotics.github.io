# Thoughts and notes after reading the game manuals

1. Will need autonomous routines for both places on red and blue sides
2. Start with Purple ready to score and yellow backup
3. Penalty for descoring opponents pixels but not your own.
4. Cannot alter drone after inspected. Question? How many drones do we need inspected incase of damage?
5. Different april tags are used for red and blue side
6. Robot may control a MAX of 2 pixels and the drone at one time.
7. Knocking over a stack of pixels is allowed, either by claw or ramming

## Auto Tasks
1. Park in backstage 5 pts
2. Purple placed on correct spike with team prop 20 pts
3. Yellow pixel placed over correct april tag 20 pts
4. Any other pixels scored on backdrop 5 pts or pushed in backstage 3 pts

## Driver Controlled
1. Pixel on backdrop 3 pts
2. Pixel in backstage 1 pt
3. 10 pts bonus per line crossed on the way up, MAX of 30 pts

## End Game
1. Suspend 20 pts
2. Park backstage 5 pts
3. Fire the drone 30,20,10
